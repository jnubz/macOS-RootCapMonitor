Script to Monitor an AFPS formatted Hard Drive via RMM

## Scope

This is a zsh script that utilizes `df` in order to determine **percent full**. This will echo the amount in plain text which you can use in a monitoring alert on an RMM service like Datto RMM. I uploaded this script to the Datto ComStore as well.
